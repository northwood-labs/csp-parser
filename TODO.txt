WIP. Once this is mostly working, I'll move it to the main repo's issues.

* Each policy has an associated source, which is either "header" or "meta".
* Each policy has an associated self-origin, which is an origin that is used when matching the 'self' keyword.
* Add SARIF output format.
* Duplicated directives should be ignored. The first takes precedence.
* 'unsafe-inline' or data: are warnings
* Apply inheritance across the tree
* Implement deeper evaluation of the policy
* Parse HTML content to match things like meta tags and script/style elements
* Column and snippet information
* Review https://github.com/google/csp-evaluator

----

As defined above, special URL schemes that refer to specific pieces of unique
content, such as "data:", "blob:" and "filesystem:" are excluded from
matching a policy of * and must be explicitly listed.

Especially for the default-src and script-src directives, policy authors
should be aware that allowing "data:" URLs is equivalent to unsafe-inline and
allowing "blob:" or "filesystem:" URLs is equivalent to unsafe-eval.

4.2.2.3. Paths and Redirects

In order to protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), web application
authors SHOULD include: both the script-src and object-src directives, or
include a default-src directive, which covers both scripts and plugins.

In either case, authors SHOULD NOT include either 'unsafe-inline' or data: as
valid sources in their policies. Both enable XSS attacks by allowing code to
be included directly in the document itself; they are best avoided
completely.

connect-src example.com
All of the following will fail with the preceding directive in place:
* new WebSocket("wss://evil.com/");
* (new XMLHttpRequest()).open("GET", "https://evil.com/", true);
* new EventSource("https://evil.com");

7.7.2. Multiple Host Source Values
